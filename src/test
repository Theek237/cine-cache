    //     Cinema has been a transformative art form since its inception in the
    //     late 19th century. From the silent films of Charlie Chaplin to the
    //     groundbreaking visual effects of modern blockbusters, the evolution of
    //     filmmaking techniques has continuously pushed the boundaries of
    //     storytelling. Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, and
    //     Akira Kurosawa redefined what was possible through the camera lens,
    //     influencing generations of filmmakers to come.

    //     Film preservation represents one of the most critical challenges facing
    //     the cinematic world today. Many early films were recorded on nitrate
    //     film, which is highly flammable and deteriorates rapidly. Archives
    //     around the world work tirelessly to restore and digitize these fragile
    //     pieces of cultural history before they are lost forever. The process
    //     involves meticulous frame-by-frame restoration, color correction, and
    //     audio enhancement. Without these efforts, significant portions of our
    //     shared cinematic heritage would simply disappear. Organizations like the
    //     Film Foundation, established by Martin Scorsese, have been instrumental
    //     in raising awareness about the importance of film preservation.

    //     The rise of streaming platforms has fundamentally altered how audiences
    //     consume and engage with film content. Services like Netflix, Amazon
    //     Prime, and Disney+ have created unprecedented access to diverse films
    //     from around the world, while simultaneously challenging traditional
    //     theatrical distribution models. This shift has sparked debates about the
    //     future of cinema, with some lamenting the decline of the communal
    //     theater experience while others celebrate the democratization of access.
    //     Independent filmmakers now have more avenues to reach audiences, though
    //     discoverability remains a significant hurdle in an increasingly crowded
    //     digital landscape.
